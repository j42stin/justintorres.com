## I'm Justin!

My interests include staying physically active, pondering the reason(s) why, cooking, and traversing the internet as a developer for 20+ years. Since 2009, I have been working with the Adviatech team to make Webby Award winning sites. My primary role is full WordPress stack development, maintenance, and technically supporting a network of 50+ sites.
